EDPPM Route Planner v1.3

The EDPPM Route Planner is a companion tool to EDPPM (Elite Dangerous PowerPlay Monitor) designed to calculate and visualize efficient travel routes between multiple star systems in Elite Dangerous.

Its primary goal is to reduce total travel distance when visiting many systems by applying Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) techniques, while remaining responsive for large system lists.

🧭 Purpose

Minimize total jump distance across many systems

Avoid inefficient zig-zag routing

Provide a clear visual and textual route order

Support PowerPlay, BGS, and logistics planning

This tool is offline-first and operates on locally stored system data.

🚀 Features

📍 Multi-System Route Optimization

Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solver

Greedy + 2-opt refinement (fast approximate mode)

Exact TSP for small system counts

🧠 Performance-Aware Design

Automatically switches to approximate solver for large routes

Prevents UI freezing on large datasets

📊 3D Route Visualization

Dark Elite-style plot theme

Connected path lines between systems

Start/end clearly marked

📋 Route Output

Numbered visit order

Total route distance (LY)

Per-leg distances

One-click copy of system names

🖥️ Elite-Themed UI

Black background, orange highlights

Non-harsh plot colors

Responsive layout

📦 Data Sources
Source	Purpose
EDSM.net	System coordinates
Local JSON Files	Cached system data
Manual Imports	Pre-built system lists

⚠️ The Route Planner does not pull PowerPlay or faction state data.
It focuses only on spatial optimization.

⚙️ Routing Logic Overview

Small lists (<10 systems)
→ Exact TSP solver

Medium lists (10–30 systems)
→ Greedy nearest-neighbor + 2-opt

Large lists (30+ systems)
→ Fast approximate heuristic to avoid lag

This ensures the UI remains usable even with large planning jobs.

⚠️ Known Limitations

Routes are optimized for distance only

Does not account for:

Jump range

Neutron boosting

Permit locks

Supercruise time

These may be added in future versions.

🧠 Relationship to EDPPM

This tool is designed to be used alongside EDPPM, not as a replacement.

Typical workflow:

Use EDPPM to identify systems needing action

Export or copy system list

Use EDPPM Route Planner to minimize travel distance
