You can get the exe and just run that from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/105aa1y6HImFj31ZvD36WhrI6ABu_ebNb?usp=sharing

Or follow these steps.

📦 Dependencies & Setup

This repository contains two separate Python programs:

EDPPM v1.3 – Powerplay Monitor

EDPPM Route Planner v1.3

Each program has its own dependency requirements, listed below.

🔹 EDPPM v1.3 – Powerplay Monitor
✅ Step 1 – Install Python

Python 3.10 or newer (Windows)

Download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/

During install, check:

✅ Add Python to PATH

✅ tcl/tk (Tkinter)

Verify:

python --version

✅ Step 2 – Required Python Packages

Install the following packages:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml

What each package does
Package	Purpose
requests	Pulls data from EDSM and Inara
beautifulsoup4	Parses Inara HTML pages
lxml	Fast HTML/XML parser for BeautifulSoup
✅ Step 3 – Built-In Modules (No Install Needed)

These come with Python:

tkinter – GUI

json – Local data storage

datetime – Time calculations

time – Throttling requests

re – Pattern matching

os – File handling

webbrowser – PayPal link

✅ Step 4 – Run the Program
python EDPPM_1_3.py

⚠️ Notes

Inara scraping is rate-limited – use Refresh Now sparingly

If your data on the GUI shows unknown... log into inara. 

Cached JSON data is used between refreshes

Program will continue to function even if live data is unavailable

🔹 EDPPM Route Planner
✅ Step 1 – Install Python

Same as EDPPM v1.3
(Python 3.10+ required)

✅ Step 2 – Required Python Packages

Install all Route Planner dependencies:

pip install requests psutil numpy scipy matplotlib

What each package does
Package	Purpose
requests	Pulls system coordinates from EDSM
psutil	Detects EDMarketConnector.exe
numpy	Vector distance calculations
scipy	TSP / route optimization
matplotlib	3D route plotting
✅ Step 3 – Built-In Modules (No Install Needed)

tkinter

json

datetime

time

os

webbrowser

✅ Step 4 – Run the Program
python ed_route_planner_1_3.py

⚠️ Notes

Large routes may take longer due to TSP optimization

Approximate TSP is used for large system counts to prevent lag

EDMarketConnector is recommended

📄 Optional – requirements.txt (Combined)

If users want everything for both programs:

requests
beautifulsoup4
lxml
psutil
numpy
scipy
matplotlib


Install with:

pip install -r requirements.txt

To build the exe with Icon:
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=edppm.ico .\EDPPM_1_3.py
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=edppm.ico .\EDPPM_RoutePlanner_1_3.py
